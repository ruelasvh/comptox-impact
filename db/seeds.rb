    bio: "<span id=\"bio-aoe\">Area of Expertise:</span><p>Dr. Martin&apos;s doctorate work focused on developing predictive models of reproductive toxicity and the application of those models toward chemical prioritization and integrated testing strategies. He started his career at Versar Inc. as an environmental scientist working at EPA doing antimicrobial pesticide risk assessment and eventually to CH2M Hill Inc. as a database analyst. He began his career at EPA as part of the EPA Intern Program (now called the Environmental Careers Program) where he was able to do rotations across different parts of the agency, including the Office of Pesticide Programs and Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics. He is now a biologist within NCCT, where he is part of the EPA ToxCast team and leads the Toxicity Reference Database (ToxRefDB) effort. Matt also serves as the CSS task lead for developing predictive models of toxicity using high throughput screening data.</p><br><span id=\"bio-edu\">Education:</span><p><ul><li>B.S., James Madison University, Harrisonburg, VA; Integrated Science and Technology (ISAT), 2003</li><li>M.S., University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Environmental Sciences and Engineering, 2008</li><li>Ph.D., University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Environmental Sciences and Engineering, 2011</li><li>Certificate, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Training Program, 2011</li></ul></p><p><span id=\"bio-pe\">Professional Experience:</span><p><ul><li>Gold Coin Recipient and Certificate of Appreciation &#8220;In recognition of dedication and service in support of the Nation&apos;s response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill&#8221;, 2011</li><li>Scientific and Technological Achievement Awards (STAA) Level II for &#8220;Communicating Toxicity Databases that Facilitate Transparency of EPA&apos;s Evaluation of Chemical Risk to the Environment and Public Health&#8221;, 2011</li><li>Scientific and Technological Achievement Awards (STAA) Level III for &#8220;Developing the ACToR System and Quantifying Data Gaps in Our Knowledge of Environmental Chemicals&#8221;, 2011</li><li>Superior Accomplishment Recognition Award (SARA) for Toxcast data analysis, 2010</li></ul></p>",
