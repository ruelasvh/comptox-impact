This edited-usa.js is the same map of the USA that comes with the DataMaps module but with an additional Washington, DC drawn to the right of the US map. This is so that the important region of Washington DC is visible to viewers of the map.

Please copy this edited-usa.js to the location of the usa map that comes with DataMaps. It is located at $WEB_HOME/node_modules/datamaps/dist/datamaps.usa.min.js.
