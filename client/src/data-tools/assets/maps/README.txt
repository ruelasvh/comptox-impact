This datamaps.usa.min.js is the same map of the USA that comes with the DataMaps module but with an additional
Washington, DC drawn to the right of the US map. This is so that the important region of Washington DC is visible
to viewers of the map.

Please copy this datamaps.usa.min.js to the location of the usa map that comes with DataMaps by running:
$ node update_usa_map.js

NOTE: This process is automated in the production build process.
